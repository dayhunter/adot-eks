# AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry on EKS

Welcome to `AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry on EKS` workshop. This workshop aims to provide developers and DevOps engineers with hands-on practice to setup AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Add-ons then trace and me. We start from containerizing an applicaiton, to deploying a practical containerized application on AWS. We will explore how to `Auto` and `Manual` Instrumentation for `Traces` and `Metrics` and integrate with `AWS X-Ray` and `Amazon CloudWatch Metrics`
